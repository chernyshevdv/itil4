# ITIL4 Foundation

Let's start with foundation: glossary, importan ideas, and so on.

Siloed approach is the main evil, against which the SVS (and ITIL4 based on it) is keen to fight.

### Symptoms of siloed approach

* Inability to act quickly or take advantage of opportunities
* Reduced ability to optimize resource use across the organzation
* Poor decision making
* Hidden agendas and increase in unhealthy organizational politics
* Lack of clarity about value streams, interfaces and handoff points

## The Service Value System (SVS)

Elements of SVS:

* [Opportunity](#opportunity), [demand](#demand), [value](#value)
* [Guiding principles](#guiding-principles)
* Governance
* [Service value chain (SVC)](#service-value-chain)
* [Practices](#practices)

The SVS is designed to combat silos within organization.

### Guiding principles

These are ITIL guiding principles: 

* Focus on value
* Start where you are
* Progress iteratively with feedback
* Collaborate and promote visibility
* Think and work holistically
* Keep it simple and practical
* Optimize and automate

### Service Value Chain
