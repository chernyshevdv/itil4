## The Service Value System (SVS)

Elements of SVS:

* Opportunity, demand, value

The SVS is designed to combat silos within organization.

* Reduced ability to optimize resource use across the organzation
* Poor decision making
* Hidden agendas and increase in unhealthy organizational politics
* Lack of clarity about value streams, interfaces and handoff points
