# ITIL4 Foundation

Let's start with foundation: glossary, importan ideas, and so on.

Siloed approach is the main evil, against which the SVS (and ITIL4 based on it) is keen to fight.

### Symptoms of siloed approach

* Inability to act quickly or take advantage of opportunities
* Reduced ability to optimize resource use across the organzation
* Poor decision making
* Hidden agendas and increase in unhealthy organizational politics
* Lack of clarity about value streams, interfaces and handoff points

## The Service Value System (SVS)

Elements of SVS:

* [Opportunity](#opportunity), [demand](#demand), [value](#value)
* [Guiding principles](#guiding-principles)
* Governance
* [Service value chain (SVC)](#service-value-chain)
* [Practices](#practices)

The SVS is designed to combat silos within organization.

### Guiding principles

These are ITIL guiding principles: 

1. Focus on value
2. Start where you are
3. Progress iteratively with feedback
4. Collaborate and promote visibility
5. Think and work holistically
6. Keep it simple and practical
7. Optimize and automate
